# Amazon Price Tracker

Welcome to my Amazon Price Tracker.

This project is built using Selenium in Python, thus acting as a human being controling Amazon, preventing it from being blocked. 

To customize your reseach, simply adapt SEARCH_TERMS in "scraper_config.py" file. Do not change the BASE_URL, as the logic behind another website might be different than the one this scraper is built for.

To launch the project, be sure to be in an environement with Selenium and Progressbar2 installed (In "requirements.txt")

Enjoy :-)
